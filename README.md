# Springboot-project
A crud application - create , read , update , delete . it is based on Springboot [java].


It's an simple crud application , consisting operations like :- add a course , delete a course , get all courses , update all courses .

For database :-
I used Mysql as a database .
Database is having a table named course with entries :- id , title , description.
I kept id as primary key . 

Future scope :-
currently just done with the bakend code , will look to write it's frontend with Angular in my free time .
